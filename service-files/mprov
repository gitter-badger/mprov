################ MASTER SERVER MODE OPTIONS #############################

# this should resolve on all the machines that need to connect to the
# master server, or at least be an IP address. Used by the Worker.
MPROV_MASTER_SERVER=master

# OPTIONAL (default 5m)
# this will set the inactive node (worker or client) purge time.
# after this time lapses, any inactive worker or client will be
# removed from the nodes the master server knows about.
# it will take the 'm' suffix to denote minutes.
MPROV_MASTER_PURGE="-u 5m"

# REQUIRED:
# this will set the path that the master node will sync out to all the
# workers.  This should contain sub-directories that are the root images
# that you want to use.  The name of the sub-directories are what the clients
# will request from the workers, and usually match profiles in your master
# provsioner.
MPROV_MASTER_PATH="-p /export/images/"

# OPTIONAL: (default 10m)
# this will set how long master server will wait before it goes through
# all the workers it knows and asks them to resync to the master image.
# NOTE: You can override this at any time by sending the master node the
# "execmd sync" command on its control port from localhost
# this option also takes the 'm' suffix to denote minutes.
MPROV_MASTER_SYNC="--sync 10m"

############### WORKER SERVER MODE OPTIONS ##########################

# REQUIRED:
# This will set the path that the worker node stores the image files in.
MPROV_WORKER_PATH="-p /export/images/"

# OPTIONAL: (default 10)
# This will set the number of "slots" the worker has to serve images
# to clients.
MPROV_WORKER_SLOTS="-s 10"

# OPTIONAL: (default 10)
# This sets how often we should send our heart beat to the master server.
# This should be LOWER than the MPROV_MASTER_PURGE option above.  It defaults
# to 10 seconds, but you can probably safely up that to 1 minute to minimize
# traffic on large systems
MPROV_WORKER_HB="-b 10"
