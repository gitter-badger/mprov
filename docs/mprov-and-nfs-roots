Setting up an NFS root image directory is pretty simple too.  I like to keep my NFS root images in /exports/ but you
can choose any directory you wish.  This document will go over setting up an initial NFS root image in /exports called
"default" and getting the mprov rpm installed.

First you need a copy of the latest version of the centos-release package.  The best, and easiest, way to do that is
to let yum grab it for you.  If you run the following command, yum will download it for you.

# yum -y --downloadonly reinstall centos-release

Yum will download that package into /var/cache/yum/x86_64/7/base/packages/

Next, you need to "install" that package into where you are going to have your NFS root image reside.  In our case, that
will be /exports/default/ so we tell RPM to install it there:

# rpm -ivh --nodeps --root /export/default/ /var/cache/yum/x86_64/7/base/packages/centos-release-*.centos.x86_64.rpm

This will install the base repo files that yum will need to build the base system from scratch.

Finally, to get a minimal system, you tell yum to install the "Minimal Install" group in the new NFS root image
directory and go have a sandwich.

 # yum -y --installroot /export/default/ groupinstall "Minimal Install"

 Once that is complete, the /export/default/ directory should contain a virgin CentOS root file system image that you
 can now go and begin manipulating however you like.

 So if you copy the mprov file in there, let's say into /export/default/tmp and then chroot into the environment,
 you should be able to install the mprov RPM.

 # chroot /export/default/
 chroot># yum -y localinstall /tmp/mprov*.rpm


 There are many ways to utilize this to create diskless or even disk based file systems off of the new NFS root image.
 I will add more documentation on how to do this in the future.
