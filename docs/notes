receiver:
    rsync --daemon --port 8790 --no-detach -v -4 --config tmpfile

    tmpfile is a config file for rsyncd that looks like this:

    [test]
        path = /tmp/rsync_test/
        read only = no
        auth users = root
        secrets file = /tmp/root_secrets
        uid = 0
        gid = 0

    rsyncd config is generated by the receiver (client/worker) and the secret will be the UUID of the worker/client

    UUID is generated at run-time (worker) or connect-time (client)

    port will be chosen at random and communicated back to the sender.

    [test] is the rsyncd module name, which will also be randomized and set back to the sender


sender:
    rsync -av --progress --password-file=./tmpfile --port 8790 ./ 10.1.2.56::test

    tmpfile contains the secret the receiver has.
    port is sent from the receiver.
    rsyncd module is sent from the receiver.
