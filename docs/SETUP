Setup of mprov is relatively simple.  First you will want to install the RPM on the master, all the workers, and the
clients (if you are using an NFS root to do this, see the documents about setting up an NFS root to work with mprov.)

On the master and worker nodes, edit /etc/sysconfig/mprov to match your setup.

On the master nodes, run: systemctl enable mprov-master

And on the worker nodes run: systemctl enable mprov-worker

Then, start the master node's service.  Once the master node is up, start the workers.  The workers may take a while to
finish their syncs.  You can check the status of the workers by telnetting to localhost:4017 on the master node.  NOTE:
the master node will not accept the following commands from a host that is not localhost.

To see the status of the workers, run: execmd list workers

This will spit out a list of all the workers the master currently knows about, and what their status is.  Once one or
more workers are in the "updated" status, then you can start running clients to pull down images.  It's really that
simple.
